# Monte-Carlo
Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate parameters or simulate phenomenon whose statistical properties are known.

There are some interesting and simple ways in which Monte Carlo methods can be employed.
One such example is to estimate the value of pi using the knowledge that the ratios of the areas of a circle with diamater $a$ contained within a square of side with the same length will be $\pi/4$
