# Monte-Carlo
Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate parameters or simulate phenomenon whose statistical properties are known.

There are some interesting and simple ways in which Monte Carlo methods can be employed.
One such example is to estimate the value of $\pi$ using the knowledge that the ratios of the areas of a circle with diamater $a$ contained within a square of side with the same length will be $\pi/4$

The usual way to imagine the Monte Carlo method in this example is to imagine darts thrown at the square in a manner that all areas of the square are uniformly covered. It follows that the ratio of the number of darts that lie inside the circle to the number of total darts will be a good estimate of aforementioned ratio, given that the entire area of the square is effectively covered.
The estimation of the ratio will improve with an increase in the number of darts.
